# Generate Training Data for Single CNN Model

## Brief Intro
This folder contains the materials for single CNN model training data generation in our paper.
As mentioned in our paper, we use BSDS-500 dataset for illustration.
Notes: The matlab code for generating training samples will be provided soon. 

## Detail
- generate_single_train.m: 80% of the dataset are used for training data generation. (Currently Unavailable)
- generate_single_test.m: the remaining images for validation data. (Currently Unavailable)
- store2hdf5.m: zip the data and store the them into .h5 format. (Currently Unavailable)
- The folder 'Label' contains uncompressed BSDS500 dataset in .bmp format.
- The folder 'qp**' contains HEVC-compressed BSDS500 dataset in .bmp format, where ** denotes the QP value.
